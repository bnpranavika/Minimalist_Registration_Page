**About the Registration Page**

This project is a minimal, interactive one-page registration form built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It is designed to be clean, responsive, and visually appealing while demonstrating modern UI/UX design patterns.

**Features and Highlights**

One-Page Form

All registration inputs (Name, Email, Password) are presented on a single page.

Simplifies user interaction and improves user experience.

**Responsive Design**

Built with Bootstrap, ensuring it looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

The form container is centered vertically and horizontally, adapting to any screen size.

**Interactive Animations**

**Form Container Hover Effect:** Slight lift and shadow when hovering over the form for a subtle 3D effect.

**Input Focus Glow:** Each input field highlights with a glowing border and background change when selected.

**Button Hover Effect:** The submit button slightly enlarges and casts a shadow on hover to indicate interactivity.

**Placeholder Fade:** Placeholders change opacity smoothly when typing for a modern feel.

**User Feedback**

The form prevents default submission using JavaScript.

On submission, a simple alert confirms successful registration.

This can be extended to send data to a backend API or localStorage.

**Easy Customization**

CSS variables and classes make it simple to adjust colors, shadows, and animations.

Additional form fields can be added easily.

**Dockerized Deployment**

The form can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

No server-side language is needed; it runs on Nginx inside a Docker container.

**How it Works**

The HTML defines the structure: labels, input fields, and a submit button.

The CSS adds styling, hover effects, and smooth transitions for a modern UI.

The JavaScript handles form submission and can be extended for client-side validation.

When run inside a Docker container, the page is served through Nginx on port 8080 (or any configured port).
